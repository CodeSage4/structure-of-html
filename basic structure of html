    What’s the next best thing to coding? The code editor, of course!
  </h3>
 Code editors are the second most significant reason for programmer flame wars (the first one being code formatting).
<!--this is a break tag br which is used in place of enter-->
<br>
<br>

To some, Vim <!-- to add multiple spaces between 2 word you use &nbsp "no break spaces -->     &nbsp &nbsp is the only sensible editor ever created, while to others everything that doesn’t fit the Inception-like spirally head-spinning world of Emacs is only fit for ridicule. If you’re badly looking for attention, all you need to do is go to a programming community and start a thread like “Why I think X (pick any popular code editor) sucks/is the best,” grab some beer and relax.

<!-- here instead of 2 break tags we can use paragraph tag p and close the para with/p -->
  <p>
Arguments, counter-arguments, and insults will keep pouring into and out of the discussion all night long, and it will take many months before the venom in the thread will cool off.</p>

<p>
  The question is: why?
</p>

<b> bold </b>

<i> italic </i>

<u> underline </u>

<br/>   <!-- another way to create a break tag also it is a single tag unlike container tag-->

<hr/> <!-- horzontal line-->

<big> big tag </big>
<small> small tag </small>

H<sub> 2 subscript tag </sub>O

<sup> superscript tag </sup>
